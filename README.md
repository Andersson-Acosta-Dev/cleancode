# cleancode

## What is clean code
First of all clean code is code that's easy to read, maintain, understand and change through structure and consistency yet remains robust and secure to withstand performance demands. It lets us get the most value out of our software.

## Principals and best practices of clean code
In order to deliver software that is of high quality, reliable, maintainable, and secure, it is imperative that the underlying code is robust. As a mean to achieve the agility, velocity, and scale of development needed for their business goals. 

### Consistent
The code is written in a uniform and conventional way. All the code looks similar and follows a regular pattern, even with multiple contributors at different times. Consistent code is **formatted**, **conventional**, and **identifiable**. For example, when code is formatted well, it is systematic and regular, which reduces differences between authorsâ€™ coding styles and makes code much easier to review by peers on pull requests.

-**Formatted**: The code presentation is well-organized, systematic, and regular.

-**Conventional**: The code performs tasks with expected instructions.

-**Identifiable**: The names follow a regular structure based on language conventions without arbitrary differences.

# cleancode

## [What is clean code](https://www.sonarsource.com/solutions/clean-code/#:~:text=Clean%20Code%20is%20code%20that's,value%20out%20of%20your%20software.)
First of all clean code is code that's easy to read, maintain, understand and change through structure and consistency yet remains robust and secure to withstand performance demands. It lets us get the most value out of our software.

## Principals and best practices of clean code
In order to deliver software that is of high quality, reliable, maintainable, and secure, it is imperative that the underlying code is robust. As a mean to achieve the agility, velocity, and scale of development needed for their business goals. 

### Consistent 
The code is written in a uniform and conventional way. All the code looks similar and follows a regular pattern, even with multiple contributors at different times. Consistent code is **formatted**, **conventional**, and **identifiable**. For example, when code is formatted well, it is systematic and regular, which reduces differences between authorsâ€™ coding styles and makes code much easier to review by peers on pull requests.

-**Formatted**: The code presentation is well-organized, systematic, and regular.

-**Conventional**: The code performs tasks with expected instructions.

-**Identifiable**: The names follow a regular structure based on language conventions without arbitrary differences.

### Intentional code
The code is clear, precise, and purposeful. Intentional code reads like it is written with attention and care to convey its purpose. Every instruction makes sense, is adequately formed, and simply communicates its behavior. Intentional code is clear, logical, complete, and efficient. For example, clear code is self-explanatory and transparently communicates its functionality, making it easier to understand the program and reducing the likelihood of bugs being introduced.

-**Clear**: The code is self-explanatory, transparently communicating its functionality.

-**Logical**: The code has well-formed and sound instructions that work together.

-**Complete**: The code constructs are comprehensive and used adequately and thoroughly.

### Adaptable code
The code is structured to evolve easily and with confidence. It makes extending or repurposing its parts easy and promotes localized changes without undesirable side effects. Adaptable code is focused, distinct, modular, and tested. For example, when code is modular it is organized and distributed to emphasize the separation between its parts, making it easier to manage and clearly define the relationships within.

-**Focused**: The code has a single, narrow, and specific scope.

-**Distinct**: The code procedures and data are unique and distinctive, without undue duplication.

-**Modular**: The code has been organized and distributed to emphasize the separation between its parts.

-**Tested**: The code has automated quality tests that provide confidence in the functionality.

### Responsible code
The code takes into account its ethical obligations on data and the potential impact of societal norms. Responsible code is lawful, trustworthy, and respectful. For example, when we classify code as lawful, we refer to it as code that respects licensing and copyright regulation, enabling a creator to license their own code and respecting others' licensing rights. Equally as important, code should be trustworthy and should not contain secrets.

-**Focused**: The code has a single, narrow, and specific scope.

-**Distinct**: The code procedures and data are unique and distinctive, without undue duplication.

-**Modular**: The code has been organized and distributed to emphasize the separation between its parts.
